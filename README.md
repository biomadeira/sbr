Structural Bioinformatics Resources
===================================

Structural Bioinformatics Resources tries to maintain a comprehensive, human curated, and updated list of tools and resources used in the field.
There are multiple webpages from researchers and groups that maintain such collections but they tend to be incomplete and to include multiple dead-links.
This resource hopes to be a community directory where everyone interested can collaborate and browse different resources and tools used in structural bioinformatics. 

Check the collection at http://structural-bioinformatics-resources.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
